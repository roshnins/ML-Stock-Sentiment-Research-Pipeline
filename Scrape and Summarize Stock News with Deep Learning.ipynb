       " <p>Futures tied to the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index nudged up 0.2%, while Dow Jones Industrial futures jumped 100 points, or around 0.4%. Meanwhile, contracts on the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped by about 0.2%.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Sizeable moves in energy markets kicked off the week, with oil prices swinging higher as reports surfaced that OPEC+ is considering a big production cut of more than one billion barrels per day. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures bounced 4.1% to $82.71 per barrel, while Brent crude climbed about 3.9% to $88.45 per barrel.</p>,\n",
